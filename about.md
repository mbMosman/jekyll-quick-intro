This site was created to introduce [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) through example.

Jekyll is a tool for building static website from templates and data files written in a combination of HTML & CSS, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Since it is used by GitHub Pages, it is easy to publish and maintain sites built using Jekyll on GitHub.

This site itself is built using Jekyll, and the pages here walk you through the details of how this site was built so that you can get started building your own blog or website using Jekyll.
