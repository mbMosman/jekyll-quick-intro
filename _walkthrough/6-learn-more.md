## Additional Resources
While the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) web site includes detailed documentation, it can be overwhelming to go through with little experience to guide you.

The following resources are the ones that I have found most helpful:

- [Jekyll Cheat Sheet](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-cheat-sheet/) - This includes notes on Jekyll, as well as basic Markdown, YAML, & Liquid syntax. Click to show/hid code snippets!

- [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) - Great for the lazy and those who just need inspiration.  There are hundreds of themes from minimalist to super fancy, all ready to install and run with.  You can also search for themes on [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=jekyll-theme), but the pictures shown directly on this site are more friendly if you don't know what you want.

- [Jekyll: GitHub Pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) - There are things you should be aware of when using GitHub Pages, many of which I learned the hard way when my site didn't work after being pushed up to GitHub.  Save yourself the trouble and read this first.

- [How I'm Using Jekyll in 2016](https://mademistakes.com/articles/using-jekyll-2016/) - This is one of the more interesting reads on Jekyll I've bumped into. It discusses one person's experiences and learnings over 4 years of working with Jekyll. While some of this goes deep for a beginner, it contains has many valuable tips.
